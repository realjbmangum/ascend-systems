          My name's Brian Mangum. I live here in Charlotte, and I've spent the last few years building software that helps small businesses make more money.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how {config.brand} started:</p>
        <p>
          I was sitting in a dentist's office in Matthews — not as a patient, just waiting on a friend — and I watched the front desk phone ring 4 times while I was there. The receptionist was busy checking someone out. Another call came in while she was on the phone. Voicemail. Voicemail. Voicemail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started paying attention. Everywhere I went — the plumber's shop on Independence, the HVAC company on 74, the attorney's office in Mint Hill — same thing. Phones ringing, nobody answering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked up the numbers. <strong class="text-charcoal">62% of calls to small businesses go unanswered.</strong> And <strong class="text-charcoal">85% of people who reach voicemail never call back.</strong> They just call the next business that picks up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought: what if I could build something that answers every call, sounds like a real person, and actually books the appointment? Not a voicemail system. Not a call center in the Philippines. An AI assistant that knows your business as well as your best employee — and never takes a day off.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal font-semibold text-xl">
          That's {config.brand}.
        </p>

      <h2 class="mb-8 reveal">Why This Exists</h2>
      <div class="space-y-5 text-lg text-gray-500 leading-relaxed reveal">
        <p>
          I'm not a venture-funded Silicon Valley startup trying to "disrupt" your industry. I'm a local guy who builds practical software for real businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          {config.brand} is a product of <strong class="text-charcoal">{config.company}</strong>, my Charlotte-based software company. I build tools that solve real problems — not trendy, not complicated, just stuff that works and makes you more money.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sell {config.brand} the old-fashioned way — in person, at Chamber meetings, door-to-door. I'll shake your hand, set up your AI assistant on the spot, and give you my personal cell number. If something's wrong, you call me.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're not getting a support ticket queue. You're getting a local business owner who answers his own phone. (Ironic, right?)
